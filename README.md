# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic paper-and-pencil game that has been enjoyed by children and adults worldwide for centuries. The game is typically played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking either an "X" or an "O" in empty squares, with the goal of being the first to achieve a row of three of their marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
